# graph-editor
This is a simple graph editor made using C++ and SFML.

## Instructions
- Left Click: Place a new node.
- Right Click: Select a node. Two selected nodes form a link.
- Middle Click: Show weight of each link
- Left Shift: Clear all nodes and links

## Features I'd like to implement
- Movable nodes
- Ability to fill a closed off cycle / loop with a colour
- Traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.)
